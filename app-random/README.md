# Random

Some *random* applications to get in touch with the library.

- `random`: Retrieve a random number (or `FF FF 00 00 ...` if unlocked)
- `sha`: Calculate SHA256 of the message.
- `chip_info`: Dump some information about the device.

## Customize

Edit `device_cfg.c` for your device. Then edit `atca_config.h` to enable proper
things.

## Build

`make`

That's it.
